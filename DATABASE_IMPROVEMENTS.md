# PostgreSQL Reliability Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to enhance PostgreSQL reliability in the Seer application codebase.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Singleton Prisma Client Pattern

Previous issue: Each file created its own Prisma Client instance, leading to connection pool exhaustion.

Solution:
- Created a singleton Prisma Client pattern in `backend/src/utils/prisma.ts`
- All database access now uses this shared client instance
- Prevents connection pool exhaustion by reusing connections

### 2. Database Operation Retry Logic

Previous issue: Database operations would fail without retry attempts, leading to application errors.

Solution:
- Added retry logic for database operations in `backend/src/utils/db-helpers.ts`
- Automatically retries failed operations that are likely to succeed on retry
- Configurable retry count and delay between attempts

### 3. Health Check Endpoint

Previous issue: No way to monitor database connectivity.

Solution:
- Added `/api/health` endpoint to monitor database connectivity
- Server starts even if database connection fails, allowing for monitoring

### 4. Database Connection Verification

Previous issue: No validation of database connection at startup.

Solution:
- Server now verifies database connection at startup
- Provides clear warning if database connection fails
- Continues to run for monitoring purposes

### 5. Improved Error Handling

Previous issue: Generic error messages didn't help diagnose database issues.

Solution:
- Better error formatting specific to database issues
- More informative error messages for troubleshooting

### 6. Database Health Check Script

Previous issue: No way to check database configuration and health.

Solution:
- Added script to check database health: `backend/src/utils/check-db-health.ts`
- Provides information about:
  - Connection status
  - PostgreSQL version
  - Current connection count
  - Maximum connections allowed

### 7. Documentation

Previous issue: Lack of guidance on proper PostgreSQL setup.

Solution:
- Added comprehensive PostgreSQL setup guide: `backend/POSTGRES_SETUP.md`
- Includes instructions for:
  - PostgreSQL installation
  - Database configuration
  - Performance tuning
  - Maintenance tasks
  - Troubleshooting common issues

## How to Use These Improvements

### Updating Existing Code

To automatically update all files to use the singleton Prisma client:

```bash
cd backend
npx ts-node scripts/update-prisma-imports.ts
```

### Checking Database Health

To check your database health and get configuration recommendations:

```bash
cd backend
npx ts-node src/utils/check-db-health.ts
```

### Monitoring Database Status

Visit the health check endpoint to monitor database connectivity:

```
http://localhost:3001/api/health
```

## Connection String Recommendations

For optimal PostgreSQL performance, use a connection string with these parameters:

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=public&connection_limit=10&pool_timeout=30&connect_timeout=10"
```

## Next Steps

1. Configure a production-ready PostgreSQL database using the recommendations in `POSTGRES_SETUP.md`
2. Set up regular database backups
3. Monitor the application for database connection issues
4. Consider using a managed PostgreSQL service for production
